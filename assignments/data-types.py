# PRACTICE

# On the line below, create a variable called four and assign
# the value 2 plus 2 to it.


# Create a variable called george that stores the type of True


# Create a variable called yarn that stores the value of the variable four
# from the first exercise as a string


# What does bool("0") evaluate to?


# Create a list containing four, george, and yarn


# Calculate 3 to the 13th power and store the result as the variable big


# What is the value of True + True? Write your answer in a comment


# What is the value of "one" + "one"?


# What is the value of [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]?
